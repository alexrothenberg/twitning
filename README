h1. Twitning Talks

A twitning talk is a 10-slide presentation where the slides automatically
advance every 10 seconds.  The name twitning talk comes from a
portmanteau of twitter and lightning talk and emphasizes its
extremely short duration of exactly 1:40.

Twitning talks are not officially associated with Twitter.
Twitning rhymes with lightning; otherwise the speaker
would be a twit.
